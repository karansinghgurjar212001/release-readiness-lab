# Release readiness report — checkout-api v2.4

**Decision: NO-GO for production** (assessment 2026-09-13). Prepared from source commit `ebe39e6` and this branch. This is an engineering recommendation, **not** a production approval or sign-off.

The original candidate lacked validation records, dependency/config verification, a rollback runbook, operational owners, risk assessment and approval. This branch provides the seven pack artifacts, upgrades two vulnerable pins, makes missing required settings fail readiness, references mandatory Secret keys, and adds a deployment preflight. Local tests pass (`4 passed`), package consistency passes, and the repeat dependency advisory scan found no known vulnerabilities.

| Gate | Current evidence | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Code validation | Local syntax and four tests; branch CI and image build still needed | Partial |
| Config and dependencies | Static mapping and dependency scan; live Secret/dependency checks absent | Partial |
| Rollback | v2.3 runbook drafted; digest and rehearsal absent | Blocked |
| Operations | Risk register complete; roster and escalation unassigned | Blocked |
| Approval | No accountable sign-off | Blocked |

The worst open risk is **High** (R1–R5). Any one of R1–R5 blocks go. In particular, no one can honestly approve a deployment whose production dependencies, rollback ability and responder are unverified.

To reach go: (1) pass this branch's CI and build/scan a digest-pinned image; (2) verify target Secret, database and Redis connectivity and staged smoke/rollout results; (3) confirm v2.3 digest and rehearse rollback, including data compatibility; (4) assign and acknowledge the named deployment/on-call/escalation roster; (5) resolve remaining High risks and obtain dated Release Owner + SRE sign-off against the exact candidate digest. Record links and evidence in this pack, then reassess. Medium risks require explicit mitigation or documented risk acceptance by the approvers.

Release Owner sign-off: **pending**. SRE sign-off: **pending**. No production deployment is authorized by this report.
