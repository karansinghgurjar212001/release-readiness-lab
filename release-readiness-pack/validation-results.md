# Validation results — checkout-api v2.4 candidate

Audit date: 2026-09-13. Source: `kalviumcommunity/release-readiness-lab` main at `ebe39e6`, plus this branch. Evidence was collected locally on Windows with Python 3.11.0; the repository CI targets Python 3.11 on Ubuntu.

Raw local command output: [local-validation.txt](./local-validation.txt).

| Check | Evidence | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Python syntax | `.venv/Scripts/python -m py_compile app/app.py app/test_app.py` | Pass |
| Unit and negative configuration tests | `.venv/Scripts/python -m pytest app/test_app.py -q` → `4 passed in 0.11s` | Pass |
| Installed package consistency | `.venv/Scripts/python -m pip check` → `No broken requirements found.` | Pass |
| Dependency advisory scan | `pip-audit -r app/requirements.txt --progress-spinner off` → `No known vulnerabilities found` | Pass as of audit date |
| Kubernetes manifest parse and secret references | PyYAML parse of all three `k8s/*.yaml`; deployment requires both Secret keys | Pass, static only |
| Container build and startup | Docker daemon unavailable locally (`failed to connect to the docker API ... docker_engine`) | **Not verified** |
| In-cluster rollout, dependency connectivity and rollback | No production/staging cluster access or credentials available | **Not verified** |
| Branch CI | Must attach the successful PR Actions run before approval | **Pending** |

The original tests only checked that `/health` returned 200. New negative tests verify 503 when either required setting is absent. The successful test uses placeholder URLs and proves presence checking, **not** database or Redis connectivity.

CI already includes syntax, unit tests and Docker build, but a green run for the upstream main branch would not validate this branch. Link the branch's exact run and image digest here once available. No test or build has been claimed where it could not be executed.
